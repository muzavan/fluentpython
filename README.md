# Fluent Python

My notebook/scratch pad while reading [Fluent Python](https://github.com/fluentpython/example-code) by Luciano Ramalho (Oâ€™Reilly). Copyright 2015 Luciano Ramalho, 978-1-491-94600-8.

A very recommended book since I found/learned new things that I did not utilize/use much before.

This notebook can not highlight every aspect in the book since I only take note for things that seems to be important and unknown before to me.

Read the full book to get the full notes!
